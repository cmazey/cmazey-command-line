# CCL: Cmazey Calculator

Thank you for reading this README.md page. We will be teaching you how to check out the lastest release of Cmazey Calculator. First off, you will need to clone the repository before we can continue. Open the terminal application, and copy, and paste the following command below.

> You can also download the zip file too, and extracting it
```
git clone https://github.com/cmazey/cmazey-command-line.git
```

After you have downloaded the whole source. Find it, and open the folder. The folder will be called 'cmazey-command-line'. But if you downloaded the zip file and extracting it, then it should be called 'cmazey-command-line-main'.

When you find the folder, and opened it. Assuming that the file is extracted, or the cloning process is finished. Double click an exe file called `ccl.exe`. That file is used as a shortcut to `ccl.py`. Please keep in mind that you will need python in your operating system for it to work properly.

When you head to the terms agreement. DO NOT TYPE IN YES AND CONTINUE. Instead, type in `dbugn/l`. This is a shortcut to the debug panel that I have made for to access different modules faster.
> There is a 2 type of debug option. First is the normal debug, where you type in `dbug`, and the other is `dbugn/l`. dbug is where all the logs will be, while dbugn/l is where it doesn't log anything that you do in the debug panel.

You will see lots of options like `node`, `py`, etc. But type in `math`. That is the shortcut to Cmazey Calculator, but keep in mind that it will open the .CS file rather than the executable files in the bin directories. 
> NOTE: You will need .NET 6.0 for it to work properly , overwise the build will fail, and error out.

That's how you access the lastest version of Cmazey Calculator. Please keep in mind that I am constantly updating it, and there will be bugs along the way. So if you find any bugs, then please report it in my discord server. Anyways, cheers y'all!
