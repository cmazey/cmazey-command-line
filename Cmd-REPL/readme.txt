--- CMAZEY COMMAND LINE REPL ---

-- SET UP --
Before you start using the code, make sure you have NODE.JS in your operating system. I recommend Linux and Windows for this code.
https://nodejs.org/en/

After you have NODE.JS installed. open the ZIP file and extract it, then right click and click [COPY AS FILE PATH]. (Dont use the Administrator Command Line)

After that, open the Command Line and type in cd [FILE PATH] (If you right click using Windows, it was paste in the code, also DONT USE CTRL V, use right click and click paste.)

After you did that, type in the following codes. These code will install necessary modules to make the code functional.

- npm install readline-sync
- npm install colors

After you typed in these codes, then the code is ready for use. To activate it, type in the following code:

- node ./command.js

And if you follow all of these steps, then the code is all ready for use, if you still having issues, repeat the steps and if the issue still presist, then email me at mazeycolt@sehs.net.
