## - NODEJS SET UP -
Before you start using the code, make sure you have NODE.JS in your operating system. I recommend Linux and Windows since I don't personally use MacOS.

https://nodejs.org/en/

After that, you can now start cloning the system, type the following code to clone it.
> I recommend using the [git bash](https://git-scm.com/) command line.
```
git clone https://github.com/cmazey/cmazey-command-line.git
```

After that, change the directory that is showned below.
```
cd cmazey-command-line/Cmd-REPL
```

After you did that, type in the following codes. These code will install necessary modules to make the code functional.
```
npm install readline-sync
```
```
npm install colors
```
After you typed in these codes, then the code is ready for use. To activate it, type in the following code:
```
node ./command.js
```
And if you follow all of these steps, then the code is all ready for use, if you still having issues, repeat the steps and if the issue still presist, then email me at mazeycolt@sehs.net.
