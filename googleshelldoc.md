# Cmazey Calculator: Google Shell Documentary

This documentary is going to be quick, and short. So lets begin right now. So, after the virtual machine is done forking the project. There are a few things to do before you can access more on my code. So we are going to use the terminal.

You are going to input the following commands. Which is changing to the `Cmd-REPL` directory using the `cd` command. This will changed directory from `cmazey-command-line` to `Cmd-REPL`.

```
cd Cmd-REPL
```

After that, you will type in `python`, and then `ccl.py`. This will open the `ccl.py` file using Python. Python is already pre-installed, and that also includes Node.JS, C++, and C#, so there's no need to preinstall those.

```
python ccl.py
```

That's all that you have to do. If you are experiencing some issues, then please let me know in my discord server, or open an issue request.
