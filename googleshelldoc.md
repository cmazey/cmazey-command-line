# Cmazey Calculator: Google Shell Documentary

This documentary is going to be quick, and short. So let's begin right now. So, after the virtual machine is done forking the project. Before you can access more of my code, there are a few things to do. So we are going to use the terminal.

Just to let you know, you are going to input the following commands. Which is changing to the `Cmd-REPL` directory using the `cd` command. This will change the directory from `cmazey-command-line` to `Cmd-REPL`.

```
cd Cmd-REPL
```

After that, you will type in `python`, and then `ccl.py`. This will open the `ccl.py` file using Python. Python is already pre-installed, and it also includes Node.JS, C++, and C#, so there's no need to preinstall those.

```
python ccl.py
```

That's all that you have to do. If you are experiencing some issues, please let me know in my discord server, or open an issue request.


## The Manual Way
> Directory is a fancy terminal-related term for folder

This is optional, but if you prefer to manually direct yourself to the file, and run it yourself without any need with Python Code, then you can, but you should get some prior experience with the terminal, so let me teach you some cool tricks.

First is `ls` which is used to see what's inside the directory.

So that's all that you would need experience-wise. Anyways, let's use the `cd` command to head to the `re` directory. So if you are already in the `Cmd-REPL` directory, then `cd` to the `re` directory.

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/image5.png">

```
cd re
```

When you are in the re file, then run the `ls` command, and see what directory, and/or files are in.
> If it doesn't work, then you weren't in the Cmd-REPL directory in the first place

The `math` directory stores the Cmazey Calculator. The `py` directory stores the `pycmd.py` file which is referred to as CCL: py. `node` stores the `nodecmd.js` file which is referred as CCL: node. `other` stores some additional small projects that I did, and finally. `lesson` store some lessons that I did during my freshman, and my Junior year. `pymath` is one of my new projects I made which includes a copycat-like of Cmazey Calculator, but it's very lightweight and basic, and it's going to be referred as Cmazey Pylicator.

### Accessing Cmazey Calculator

Since you are already in the `re` directory. Let cd to 2 directories, so we will be using `/` to navigate to 2 directories. So let's `cd` to  `math`, and `rere`

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/image7.png">

```
cd math/rere
```
> We are skipping the `math` directory, and heading straight to the `rere` directory because that directory stores the whole code source. `math` directory only stores the `startup.py` which we don't need to run since it's time-wasting.

After that. Now we run the command, which will create a Debug build of `mathcmd.cs` aka Cmazey Calculator. Also note: Google Shell has .NET 7.0 which is enough to run my AP project. Anyway, let's run the file now.

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/image8.png">

```
dotnet run
```

That's it, you should building, and running the file now. But if it somehow freezes, and it stops responding. Then press `CTRL + C`. This will terminate the command, and you can run the command again. If the issue persists. Then please let me know in my discord server, or create a new issue request.
