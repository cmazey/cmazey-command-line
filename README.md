**Cmazey Command Line** is a project that I started back in 2022 during my Freshman year in High School. This project includes a lot more projects that I have made which are `node command line` which is a custom command line with my commands that I made while I was learning Javascript. `py command line` is a custom command line that I made during early 2023 while I was learning python, and finally. Cmazey Calculator which is a terminal calculator that I made for fun at first, then it turned into an AP Project for my Junior year. Cmazey Command Line also includes smaller projects which are stored in `others`, and it also comes with `lessons` which store the lessons that I had to do during my Freshman and Junior years. If you are interested in trying out Cmazey Command-Line. Then head to my release page, or you can fork the entire project using Google Cloud Shell.
